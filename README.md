# s3-bucket-encryptor

A CloudFormation stack used to encrypt existing non-encrypted S3 objects of selected buckets. The code in this repo is heavily inspired by the AWS security blog post [How to retroactively encrypt existing objects in Amazon S3 using S3 Inventory, Amazon Athena, and S3 Batch Operations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-retroactively-encrypt-existing-objects-in-amazon-s3-using-s3-inventory-amazon-athena-and-s3-batch-operations/).
